1
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine?

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
No

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Had to save my money for security

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Got a stalker walking up and down the street

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Says he's Satan

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
and he'd like to meet

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
I bought a secret house when I was 17

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
Haven't had a party since I got the keys

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
On his way out, made him sign an NDA

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Once was good enough

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.500
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
You couldn't save me,

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.500
but you can't let me go,

16
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
oh, no

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.500
I can crave you, but you don't need to know

18
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.500
30 Under 30 for another year

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.000
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.700
Maybe I should think about a new career

21
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I've been having fun, getting older now

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At least I gave him something he can cry about

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I thought about my future, but I want it now

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Want it now

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can't give me up

28
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:25.000
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go,

29
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
oh, no

30
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I can crave you, but you don't need to know

31
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.500
Did I take it too far?

32
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.800
Now I know what you are

33
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.500
You hit me so hard

34
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.000
I saw stars

35
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Think I took it too far

36
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.500
When I sold you my heart

37
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000
How'd it get so dark?

38
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500
I saw stars

39
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.000
Stars

40
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Oh, oh, oh
